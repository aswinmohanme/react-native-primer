# \[WIP\] React Native Primer

Hey there Traveller, welcome to the secret \(or not so secret\) tribe of Cross Platform Native App Development. That was a mouthful wasn't it ?

This guide is written with the intention of being a simple standalone introduction to the Cross Platform Mobile App Development framework React Native \(I made you read that twice :D\). React Native is basically React \(a javascript framework\) that runs on top of a Native bridge, which helps it with it's name and also running the app at near Native Performance.

This guide is aimed at programmers who are atleast familiar with any programming language, and no HTML does not count \(although helpful\).

Together we would take you through someone who knows nothing about how mobile apps work to someone who would release thier first app on Android and IOS at the same time.

## What you will Learn

Along the way you would be Introduced to a lot of technologies that would be helpful in building your own application and releasing it on to the market, which includes

* Javascript
* React \(Duh ...\)
* React Native
* MobX for State \(Not Redux\)

We are also gonna be going over Navigation, Animations and Celebrations\(at the end of course\).

At the end of this course you would have built a plethora of Mobile Apps with React Native to showcase your skills.
